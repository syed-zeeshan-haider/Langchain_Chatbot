            "\n",
            "* **Symbolic AI (or Good Old-Fashioned AI - GOFAI):** This approach relies on explicitly programming rules and knowledge into the system.  Think of expert systems, which codify the knowledge of human experts in a particular domain (e.g., medical diagnosis).  It's brittle – it struggles with situations not explicitly covered by the rules.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Connectionism (Neural Networks):** This approach uses interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers to process information.  These networks learn from data by adjusting the strengths of connections between nodes.  This is the basis of deep learning, which has achieved remarkable success in areas like image recognition and natural language processing.  It's more robust than symbolic AI but can be difficult to understand and interpret.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Evolutionary Computation:** This approach uses evolutionary algorithms (inspired by natural selection) to optimize AI systems.  It's particularly useful for finding solutions to complex problems where traditional methods might fail.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Hybrid Approaches:** Many modern AI systems combine different approaches, leveraging the strengths of each. For instance, a system might use a neural network to process sensory data and then use symbolic reasoning to make decisions based on that data.\n",

            "\n",
            "* **Narrow or Weak AI:** This type of AI is designed to perform a specific task, such as playing chess or recommending products.  Most current AI systems fall into this category.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **General or Strong AI:** This hypothetical type of AI would possess human-level intelligence and be capable of performing any intellectual task that a human being can.  We haven't yet achieved this level of AI.\n",
            "\n",

            "* **Bias and fairness:** AI systems can inherit and amplify biases present in the data they are trained on, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes.\n",
            "* **Privacy:** AI systems often require access to large amounts of personal data, raising concerns about privacy violations.\n",
            "* **Job displacement:** Automation driven by AI could lead to significant job losses in certain sectors.\n",
            "* **Autonomous weapons:** The development of AI-powered weapons raises serious ethical and safety concerns.\n",
            "* **Accountability:** Determining responsibility when AI systems make mistakes or cause harm is a complex issue.\n",
